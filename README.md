# HelloToast
Hello Toast contains two lab exercises, first one is "Your first interactive UI" and other one is "layout editor". Both have similar project that's why i have done it in only one repository by creating different commits and branches.

Now I am going to show you a task or a complete task that i have done which are as following or both layout editor and interative ui parts:
TASK is all about the practice where i have learnt to use constrait layout, relative layout, linear layout. 

In the task, simple toast and count button added to perform the onClickListener task.

count button is used increase the number shown by textView where toast button is used to show the toast messages.
The screenshot of the task are shown in below:

In the HOMEWORK part, I have added the zero button middle of the toast and count button. Zero button is used to restore the value zero for the textView.
In this part, I also change the background color of the count button as it is even or odd and also the background color of the zero button as it is active or not.

You can see the below images for better understanding:
